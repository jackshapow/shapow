TODO:
- new user from users page submits new token and logs ppl out
- settings page ... give default location but let people set it in same place
  - if you can't get media paths working easily just disable
  - On every OS just use ~/AVA
- change logo / set name
- systray (make icons)
- build pipeline
  - platform target for systray and ffmpeg?
  - tag releases on git
  - build js pipeline
  - pack assets into golang
  - build for each os?
    - linux
    - osx
    - win
  - create OS packages
  - put binary releases
- command line flags?
- test on windows/ubuntu/clean osx
- build/packaging/installers for windows/osx?
- add licensing info

NICE TO HAVE:
- update/push into vue song array after upload.. generalized websocket?
- fix upload hover el bug

- collections/library
  - on sync upload an array of file and playlist protobufs to meetava.ai
  - on search hit grpc service http://meetava.co/Search
  - if you hit "Download"
    - copy protobuf to local collection
    - add to download queue
    - server provides array of IP addresses that have that file? stun?
  - use stun to facilitate transfers?

  - every node should be registered as online/offline
  - needs to have history of STUN success

  - have a separate badger DB for collections? or just a key-prefix?

- deploy server meetava.com
  - auto-update binary from URL
  - STUN/(disable TURN if it gets too busy?)



STRETCH GOALS:
  - Divide up content based on logged in user
  - Setup central server getinka.com
  - Push all node file data to getinka.com/files grpc
    - Have server be notified when online? Hold open an https connection.
    - Have to have active https pipe to be considered online
  - Create new tab "Collections (beta)"
    - have it ajax with JWT into getinka.com endpoint
    - return list of all matching "files" ... use JWT/grpc for all intra server communication
    - include ip address/zero tier address in the index
      - it just grpc's into that node and say "play"
      - cross site so you can stream right from that node to your local browser
      - how about nodes that are behind firewalls?

DEPLOYMENT
- what happens if you run ffmpeg parser on non-osx machine?
- auto-updating binary
  - distribution server / domain?
- auto-download ffmpeg?
- support for osx/win/linux... taskbar chrome? install process?


DONT DO THIS BEFORE CHRISTMAS
- riot/bleeve



DO IT... SOMETIME
- delayed import M3U to grab missing track lengths, artist, and album... position/track number?
- Use the audio checksum feature of dhowden/tag to ignore ID3 tags...



- on local installs be able to right-click a file and "Show in Finder/Explorer"
  - then use syscall to open the local file/folder ~/AVA/JohnDoe/

Running on darwin?

- agent running
  -> open a new browser window
  -> exit
- agent not running
  -> start agent
  -> open browser window


- launch at login - ?
- install icon on taskbar -- osascript? check to make sure not already installed
  - instead of running same app and detecting what if you just point it toward a little standalone open(http://) app?
- hide from taskbar w/ plist

- fix reset db issues
- get proper logging setup

- what about support files aka ffmpeg?




- If file is in "Applications" folder then run it as a service
